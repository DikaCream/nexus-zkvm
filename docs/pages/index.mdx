The Nexus zkVM is a modular, extensible, open-source, massively-parallelized zkVM, designed to run at *a trillion CPU cycles per second*, given enough computing power connected to it.

## What is the Nexus zkVM?

The Nexus zkVM is a machine that can prove any computation, for example any Rust program:

```rust
#![no_std]
#![no_main]

fn fib(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 1,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2),
    }
}

#[nexus::main]
fn main() {
    let n = 7;
    let result = fib(n);
    assert_eq!(result, 21);
}
```

Generating a zero-knowledge proof for any Rust program is as easy as running:

```bash
cargo nexus prove
```

And verification is as simple as running:

```bash
cargo nexus verify
```

To get started with the Nexus zkVM, check out the [Quick Start](/quick-start.mdx) guide.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Nexus is in experimental stages and not recommended for production use. The system has low performance and high costs. Many future upgrades are expected.

### Open Source, Extensibility, and Modularity

Open-source and fully-transparent science, cryptography and benchmarks are the core ethos of the Nexus project. The Nexus zkVM is designed to be modular and extensible, with highly optimized isolated components:

- **The Nexus Prover**: A prover that provides the first production-grade implementations of folding-scheme provers like [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370), [CycleFold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1192.pdf), [SuperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1758.pdf), [HyperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573.pdf), and more, to enable highly efficient Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC).
- **The Nexus Virtual Machine**: A minimal, general-purpose virtual machine designed to optimize prover performance. The NVM can run programs in any high-level language (e.g. Rust, C++, etc), or emulate with minimal overhead any Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) (e.g. RISC-V, EVM, Wasm).
- **The Nexus Compiler**: A safe and correct compiler that compiles high-level languages and any other ISAs to the NVM, with compiler optimizations designed to maximize prover performance.
- **The Nexus Co-Processor System**: Nexus co-processors are custom extensions on the NVM instruction set, like SHA-256, keccack256, etc, that developers can use to accelerate specific computations. Nexus co-processors are exactly like Ethereum precompiles, but in the context of zkVMs. Developers can extend the zkVM with custom co-processors, and import other developer's co-processors. This is only possible due to the non-uniform IVC system introduced by [SuperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1758.pdf).
- **The Nexus Proof Compressor**: A proof compression sequence of recursive SNARKs that compresses proofs with each recursive application of a SNARK. Nexus (Nova) proofs are inherently large, so they can be compressed through recursive applications of this system down to a few bytes.

## Architecture and Science

For an in depth look at the science behind the Nexus zkVM and the Nexus Network, see the [Nexus Whitepaper](https://nexus.xyz/whitepaper). We briefly describe the Nexus system.

### The Nexus zkVM

The Nexus zkVM is a massively paralellized, general-purpose, prover-optimized, zkVM. It is powered by a massivelly-parallelized proof aggregation mechanism, based on Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) and (multi)-folding schemes, such as [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370), [CycleFold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1192.pdf), [SuperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1758.pdf), [HyperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573.pdf), and more.

We provide the first production-grade open-source implementation of folding schemes: https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm, which we hope is useful for the broader community.

### The Nexus Network

The Nexus Network is a massivelly parallelized prover network, running the Nexus zkVM. The Nexus Network is a distributed supercomputer, operated by Nexus Labs, inspired by the SETI@Home project. 

The Nexus Network aggregates the CPU / GPU computing power of an untrusted distributed prover network to scale the throughput of the Nexus zkVM by orders of magnitude.

To sign up to provide compute to the Nexus Network, contact us at `hello@nexus.xyz`.

### The Nexus Virtual machine

The Nexus Virtual Machine (NVM) is a simple and minimal Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to maximize prover performance.

Many more details will be released in the coming months.
