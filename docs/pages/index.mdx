*Documentation for Nexus zkVM users and developers.*

The Nexus zkVM is a modular, extensible, open-source, massively-parallelized zkVM, designed to run at *a trillion CPU cycles proved per second* given enough machine power.

Welcome to the Nexus documentation.  Here you will find docs for:

- **The Nexus zkVM**: A massively-parallelized zkVM
    - A machine that can generate zero-knowledge proofs for any program, with initial support for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

- **The Nexus Network**: A zkVM supercomputer
    - A massivelly parallelized prover network, jointly running the Nexus zkVM.

To get started with using the Nexus zkVM, check out the [Quick Start](/quick-start.mdx) guide.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Nexus is in experimental stages and not recommended for production use. The system has low performance and high costs. Many future upgrades are expected.

## The science behind Nexus

For an in depth look at the science behind the Nexus zkVM and the Nexus Network, see the [Nexus Whitepaper](https://nexus.xyz/whitepaper). We briefly describe the Nexus system.

### The Nexus zkVM

The Nexus zkVM is a massively paralellized, general-purpose, prover-optimized, zkVM. It is powered by a massivelly-parallelized proof aggregation mechanism, based on Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) and (multi)-folding schemes, such as [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370), [CycleFold](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1192.pdf), [SuperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1758.pdf), [HyperNova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573.pdf), and more.

We provide the first production-grade open-source implementation of folding schemes: https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm, which we hope is useful for the broader community.

### The Nexus Network

The Nexus Network is a massivelly parallelized prover network, running the Nexus zkVM. The Nexus Network is a distributed supercomputer, operated by Nexus Labs, inspired by the SETI@Home project. 

The Nexus Network aggregates the CPU / GPU computing power of an untrusted distributed prover network to scale the throughput of the Nexus zkVM by orders of magnitude.

To sign up to provide compute to the Nexus Network, contact us at `hello@nexus.xyz`.

### The Nexus Virtual machine

The Nexus Virtual Machine (NVM) is a simple and minimal Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to maximize prover performance.

Many more details will be released in the coming months.

Next, try out the Nexus zkVM yourself to prove example Rust programs: See the [Quick Start](/quick-start.mdx) guide.
